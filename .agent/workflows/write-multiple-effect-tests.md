# Write Multiple Effect Tests

## Goal

Write multiple integration tests, one per battle effect, as instructed by the user.

## Process

You will execute /write-effect-test for multiple battle effects. The only difference is that all requirements MUST be received up front.

1. Gather requirements for ALL effects up front (Step 1 of /write-effect-test) for all effects.
2. Generate a plan artifact with a section for EACH effect being tested (Steps 2 and 3 of /write-effect-test). Each effect MUST have its own section with ALL information required in Step 3 of /write-effect-test.
3. After user approval, execute the plan.

You MUST follow all instructions in /write-effect-test.
